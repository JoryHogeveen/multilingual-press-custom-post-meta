# MultilingualPress - Addon: Sync Custom Post Meta
MLP Addon: Sync custom post meta fields with network admin for default and custom post types

## Status

Version 0.1 - NOT FOR PRODUCTION

### TODO

- Multiple meta values with the same key
- Meta values that are image attachments 
  - Thoughts are welcome since these meta values are dependent on the type of custom fields plugin
  - I think this will need additional addons for different custom fields plugins
- Security and code-format improvements

#### Optional:
- Overwrite default sync settings on a per-post basis
